# EPFL Noto
    
EPFL provides a centralized JupyterLab platform for students called [Noto](https://www.epfl.ch/education/educational-initiatives/cede/digitaltools/noto/), allowing you to run all these notebooks without having to install anything on your computer. This is because those notebooks are running in the cloud (i.e. on a remote server, with which you directly interact through the JupyterLab interface).

To clone this repository on EPFL Noto, click on this link: https://go.epfl.ch/ME-390-2022.

As in a local Python installation, you will need to frequently `git pull` the most recent changes in order to ensure that your files are up-to-date.

**Warning**: You'll need a stable internet connection to run these labs through Noto, as it runs in the cloud. This is not the case when running the notebooks locally, even though we're still using a web browser to access Jupyter Lab.

## Other cloud-based notebook platforms
There exist other online platforms offering cloud-based Jupyter Notebooks. These platforms could enable faster computation time. Notably:

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which offers free GPU runtimes, which is very useful for some machine learning tasks (such as training neural networks).
- [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/), which offers real-time collaboration (useful for group projects).

**Note**: We do not provide any support for using these platforms.
